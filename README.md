# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Docker üê≥
### Pre-requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
Before running the project, ensure that you have completed the following steps:

1. Create a file named `.env.docker` in the root directory of the project;
2. Copy the contents from `.env.docker.example` into the `.env.docker` file;
3. Update the values in the .env.docker file with the required data.
```bash
# Execute steps 1 and 2 in single command
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
```

The `.env.docker` file is used to store environment variables that are
required for the Docker container to run.
By copying the example file and updating the values,
you can ensure that the application will have the necessary configuration
to run properly.

Available containers

| Name         | Description                |
